# Final-Project

## Purpose of the Project

This project explores global video game sales using data sourced from VGChartz. The goal is to analyze trends across genres, platforms, publishers, and regions to uncover key insights into consumer behavior and market performance. This analysis can provide valuable business intelligence for game developers, publishers, and marketers looking to understand industry dynamics and target audiences more effectively.

## Data Science Questions
There was 5 data science questions that I answered during this project:
1. Which video game genres have generated the most global sales over time?
2. Are there clear regional preferences for certain genres or platforms?
3. Which publishers consistently release high-performing games?
4. Which platforms have the most top-selling titles?
5. Do older games have better sales performance than newer releases?
